### Docker Compose
Use Docker Compose to replace run commands you're using over and over again.

# What is Docker Compose?
Docker Daemon is responsible for:
    Pulling images and starting containers
    It helps run multiple docker containers much easier than with docker run commands
    Managing volumenes, networks, and DNS

The REST API provides access to the Daemon
    Available locally at /var/run/docker.sock

    `up` - Spin up al the services
    `down` - tear it all down
    `logs` - view all logs in a single stream
