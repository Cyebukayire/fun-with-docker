### Docker Intro

Docker is a platform for building, running and shipping applications
It can run and function the same way on other machines.

Docker creates isolated environments to install all dependencies and run your application anywhere

# Container
A container is an isolated environment for running an application.

With containers we can:
    Allow running multiple apps in isolation
    Are lightweight
    Use OS of the host
    Start quickly
    Need less harware resources

# Application
To dockerize your application just add a docker file in the root directory of your project. This docker file turns the application into an image that contains everything our application needs to run

# Image
Image contains:
    A cut-down OS
    A runtime environment eg: node
    Application files
    Third-party Libraries
    Environment variables

Once we have our image, we tell docker to start container using that image and our application gets loaded inside the container.
Instead of running our application on our machine, we tell docker to run it inside a container.

Once we have this image we can push it to registry like docker hub. Docker hub to docker is like github to git. It's a storage for docker images that anyone can use. So, any machine running docker can pull our image and run it.
